# Email Verification Library for PHP

Kickbox determines if an email address is not only valid, but associated with a actual user. Uses include:

* Preventing users from creating accounts on your applications using fake, misspelled, or throw-away email addresses.
* Reducing bounces by removing old, invalid, and low quality email addresses from your mailing lists.
* Saving money and projecting your reputation by only sending to real email users.

## Getting Started

To begin, hop over to [kickbox.io](http://kickbox.io) and create a free account. Once you've signed up and logged in, click on **API Settings** and then click **Add API Key**. Take note of the generated API Key - you'll need it to setup the client as explained below.

## Installation

Make sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed.

Add the following to your composer.json

```js
{
    "require": {
        "kickbox/kickbox": "*"
    }
}
```

Update your dependencies

```bash
$ php composer.phar update
```

> This package follows the `PSR-0` convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate these classes loading in your own autoloader.

#### Versions

Works with [ 5.4 / 5.5 ]

## Usage

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Then we instantiate a client (as shown below)
```

### Build a client

__Using this api without authentication gives an error__

##### Authorization header token

```php
$client = new Kickbox\Client('1a2b3', $clientOptions);

 * __api_version__: Default version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __user_agent__: Default user-agent for all requests
 * __headers__: Default headers for all requests
 * __request_type__: Default format of the request body

### Response information

__All the callbacks provided to an api call will recieve the response as shown below__

```php
$response = $client->klass('args')->method('args', $methodOptions);

$response->code;
// >>> 200

$response->headers;
// >>> array('x-server' => 'apache')
```

##### JSON response

When the response sent by server is __json__, it is decoded into an array

```php
$response->body;
// >>> array('user' => 'pksunkara')
```

 * __api_version__: Version of the api (to be used in url)

### Request body information

Set __request_type__ in options to modify the body accordingly

##### RAW request

```php
$body = 'username=pksunkara';
// >>> 'username=pksunkara'
```
